<section id="content">
I am enjoying my break in service from the UN. Travelling to Nairobi and La Reunion, with a quick detour via Paris and the north of Italy.

Trying to publish my website (this website!). Focused on referencing and sharing the articles, books and conversations that have most inspired me and what others can learn from them.Trying to actually publish some of my photos, but that requires a bit more work than just 

Also trying to plan the next phase of my <a href="http://innovation.wfp.org/project/dalili"> current piece of work </a>. We are planning expand to other countries, but that represents as much work as new opportunities.
