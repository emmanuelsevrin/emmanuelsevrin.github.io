	1. <h3 href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html"><a> WaitbutWhy - Religion for the Noneligious</a></h3>
	<p>Tim Urban has a uncanny capacity to dissect complex human problems with a beautiful mixture of emotional intelligence and analytical skills. Whatever the issue, he faces it with clear eyes and all his brain, and the result is wisdom accessible to all. That makes it particularly useful to reach his post on spirituality and consciousness.

	2. <h3 href="https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck"><a>2. The subtle art of not giving a fuck - by Mark Manson</a></h3>
	<p>I've loved Mark Manson for two years now. He's arguably the one who's taught me mot about personality, confidence and interpersonal relationship . He's been threading the questions of freedom and maturity along many of his articles, and this posting summarizes it best, I think. Remarkably funny as well. A good opening to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019MMUA8S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"> 	book </a>. 
 	</p>

	<p class="article">
	3. <h3 href="https://www.estherperel.com/podcast"><a>Where should we begin - by Esther Perel</a></h3>
	<p>Each episode is a one-hour recorded couple therapy. I recognized myself in previous relationships. The anger, the frustration, the loneliness. Fascinating to see how so many humans experience the same things. And I was amazed by Esther Perel’s skill and technique. So often does she finds the right word, the right diagnosis, or the right question. It's beautiful. I have come to find that in therapy, skillset and talent makes the difference between a one-sided dialogue and a team working towards progress. So much to learn here.

	4. <h3 href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one"><a>Serial - season One - by Sara Konig</a></h3>
	<p>An in-depth analysis of a murder history and subsequent trial that took place in the USA 20 years ago. Sarah Konig, the journalist, analyses the case with unprecedented care and detail, going through every single detail such as the cell towers and each witness testimony. Listening to this podcast during a road-trip was one of my best experiences in 2015. Riveting.

	<h2><a>The Life you can save - by Peter Singer</a></h2>
	<p>Best book on morality I’ve ever read. Forget Kant and the New Testament. This book challenged my personal moral system like no other and gave me a new way to consider my professional life and personal goals. At a minimum, the author points to the contradictions within us and forces us to reevaluate our personal moral system. At best, it can lead to the end of poverty and a new moral order.  </p>

	<h2><a>Models - by Mark Manson</a></h2>
	<p>Yes, it’s a book about seduction, attracting women, and finding romance or love. It’s the best book on the topic, but more importantly it goes way beyond this and addresses questions about personality, attractiveness, and social relationships. Much deeper than all the pick-up books of the world - and way more effective. Useful for both genders as well. </p>

	<h2><a>The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck - by Mark Manson</a></h2>
	<p>Another Mark Manson book on how to live. This one somehow made it to best-seller status, although I have found the other one more thought-provoking and inspiring. Nevertheless, it’s a deep piece of writing on our values and how to act according to them. Some brilliant passages.  </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="Happy - by Derren Brown" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/Happy.gif" alt="Happy - by Derren Brown"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>Happy - by Derren Brown</a></h2>
	<p>Powerful reminders of how the day-to-day experience of our lives is driven by our judgement more than the actual reality. Practical thoughts on how to apply those principles in many challenges of modern life, such as distraction, anger, anxiety and by rewriting our own personal stories. I was reminded of how much personal work I still need to do to engage creatively and generously with the people around me.  </p>
