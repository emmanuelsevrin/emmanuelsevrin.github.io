	<h3>1. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html">WaitbutWhy - Religion for the Noneligious</a></h3>
	<p>Tim Urban has a uncanny capacity to dissect complex human problems with a beautiful mixture of emotional intelligence and analytical skills. Whatever the issue, he faces it with clear eyes and all his brain, and the result is wisdom accessible to all. That makes it particularly useful to reach his post on spirituality and consciousness.

	<h3>2. <a href="https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck">The subtle art of not giving a fuck - by Mark Manson</a></h3>
	<p>I've loved Mark Manson for two years now. He's arguably the one who's taught me mot about personality, confidence and interpersonal relationship . He's been threading the questions of freedom and maturity along many of his articles, and this posting summarizes it best, I think. Remarkably funny as well. A good opening to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019MMUA8S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"> 	book </a>.

	<h3>3. <a href="https://www.estherperel.com/podcast">Where should we begin - by Esther Perel</a></h3>
	<p>Each episode is a one-hour recorded couple therapy. I recognized myself in previous relationships. The anger, the frustration, the loneliness. Fascinating to see how so many humans experience the same things. And I was amazed by Esther Perelâ€™s skill and technique. So often does she finds the right word, the right diagnosis, or the right question. It's beautiful. I have come to find that in therapy, skillset and talent makes the difference between a one-sided dialogue and a team working towards progress. So much to learn here.

	<h3>4. <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one">Serial - season One - by Sara Konig</a></h3>
	<p>An in-depth analysis of a murder history and subsequent trial that took place in the USA 20 years ago. Sarah Konig, the journalist, analyses the case with unprecedented care and detail, going through every single detail such as the cell towers and each witness testimony. Listening to this podcast during a road-trip was one of my best experiences in 2015. Riveting.

	<h3>5. <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/12/28/derek-sivers-reloaded-on-success-habits-and-billionaires-with-perfect-abs/">Derek Sivers Reloaded - by Tim Ferris</a></h3>
	<p>Derek Sivers is a brilliant man who spent too many years becoming a millionnaire instead of sharing his wisdom with the crowd. In this episode, he shares his learnings after years of studying alone what happiness and improvement means. I listened to this podcast on a road to the bavarian mountains, one day when I was truly depressed, and it cheered me up like nothing.

	<h3>6. <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/10/27/david-heinemeier-hansson/">David Heinemeier Hansson - the Tim Ferriss podcast</a></h3>
	<p>David Heinemeier Hansson is a successful programmer (he wrote Ruby on Rail) and CTO (he co-founded Basecamp). That's not why this podcast is so deep. He talks about flow, learning, happiness, and most importantly, our definition of success.

	<h3>7. <a href="https://markmanson.net/do-something">Just do something - by Mark Manson</a></h3>
	<p>A short, action-oriented, motivating article if you feel depressed, stuck, or even angry.

	<h3>8. <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/what-is-technology-doing-to-us/">What is Technology doing to us - waking up with Sam Harris; with Tristan Harris</a></h3>
	<p>Wow. I tend to have a positive outlook on the potentiality of new technologies, arguing that it's up to individuals to learn how to make the best of it, and that culture, discipline and mindfulness will, over time, make us better maters of this tools. However, this podcast is the best indictment of that perspective. Tristan Harris, a former design ethistic at Google (how cool of a title is that!) explains in with accurate detail how mobile technology is slowly removing our sense of agency, and start asking how we can regain some control over it
