    <h2> Decisions</h2>
  </section>

<section id="content">

<p> My capacity to make choices depends heavily on my emotional state. When I feel stressed, tired, or insecure, any single decision - no matter how small - becomes excruciating. I overthink everything. I obsess about the losses. I second-guess myself.</p> 

<p> When I am happy and upbeat, things get so much easier. I confidently go into the choice of my preference. Any potential issue? Sure, but they'll be managed along the way! There are no problems, only solutions ! I know what I want, I think I can get it, and I joyously laugh at the potential risks or consequences. </p>

<p> All of this tells me that making decisions, beyond its intellectual, 'pros-and-cons’, ‘draw your list of values' element, has a huge emotional component. Especially for the big, consequential decisions. </p>

<p> That’s the component I would like to focus on here. </p>

<p> We know it’s hard to take decisions, because any choice involves losses, and we are wired to be more reluctant to losses than we are to gains. When we feel well and happy, we handle losses much better than when we feel down. When we feel emotionally healthy, we are in a better position to weigh the potential gains adequately, to focus on what’s most important for us, and to drive towards this. We don’t obsess only about losses but also reflect about potential gains and make less fear-driven decision. </p>

<p> I would like to argue that things cuts both ways. It’s a virtuous circle. By forcing ourselves to regularly take hard decisions and face losses, we see the liberating, self-affirming effects of those decisions. We get closer to living a dynamic life when we are able to face losses in the eyes, shrug them off, free ourselves up and jump on the next steps. Because most opportunities can only be taken if we courageously and spontaneously accept their consubstantial losses. </p>

<p> In my past, I've made some great decisions and I've made some pretty dumb ones. Some were painful and some brought me joy. The happiest decisions always involved a leap of faith towards unknown. And I spent a fair amount of time regretting the dumbest ones. </p>

<p><b> However, I don't think I could have avoided any bad decision.</b></p>

<p> If I couldn’t figure out the path forward in one week, it was unlikely I could figure it out in one or three month. Moreover, it’s not clear at all to me that thinking it through longer leads to a better assessment of the risks and potential upsides. Like jumping into cold water, that’s easy in the first seconds and hard after one minute, sometimes we get more risk-averse and obsessive with the most time we spend mulling. </p>

<p> As one of my friend said, we learn with time that taking a decision - even the wrong decision - is often better than not taking one at all. </p>

<p> What I’ve regretted most are all the ‘small' decisions that I have consistently overlooked. Reconnecting with a friend. Reading this new book. Writing more. Journaling. Cooking. Meditating. Over time, those ’tiny', every-day decisions that I made add up and would have made me a brand new person much more effectively than all this time lost mulling over big ‘career’ or ‘heart’ decisions. </p>

<p> And somehow, I feel that all this time I’ve spent mulling over the big decisions in life were a hindrance to the big choices. </p>

<p> So, in summary:
<li> 1. Decisions are an emotional process as much as an intellectual one </li>
<li> 2. It’s a virtuous circle: just as much as being emotional healthy helps making 'tough calls’; we enhance our emotional health by making them early </li>
<li> 3. A decision - even the wrong decision - is often better than not taking one at all </li>
<li> 4. In the past, I’ve regretted most the decision </li>
