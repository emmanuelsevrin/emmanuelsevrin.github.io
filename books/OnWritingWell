TITLE: On Writing well - by William Zinsser
SHORTCUT: OnWritingWell
ISBN: 978-0060891541

SUMMARY:
An extensive essay on sharing our thoughts more effectively. Since itâ€™s a meta book (writings about writing), you can easily compare how effective the writer is in applying his own piece of  advice. And he definitely is ðŸ˜ƒ.  One of the most inspiring books Iâ€™ve read recently.

WHAT STUCK WITH ME:
How good writing is inherently connected with good thinking. How pleasant it is to hear that style isnâ€™t connected to artificially adding sophisticated words. For someone constantly sifting through long papers or emails that donâ€™t actually say anything, this was surprisingly refreshing.

GOOD FOR YOU IF: 
You are an aspiring writer who wants to learn how to do this well from the pros. 

NOT FOR YOU IF:  	
You thing words are useless pieces of shit.
