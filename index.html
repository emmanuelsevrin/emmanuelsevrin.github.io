    <h2>Me in 10 seconds</h2>
    <p>
    During the week, I work as a project manager for the <a href="www.wfp.org"> United Nations World Food Programme</a>. You can read about my current work <a href="http://innovation.wfp.org/project/dalili"> here</a>, and <a href="https://innovation.wfp.org/"> there</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    During my free time, I write about inspiration and learning. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I spent the last 10 years of my life travelling and always looking for the next big thing. Now I try to focus on learning and building things useful for others. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm a resolute <a href=https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality> INTJ</a>. People tell me I am analytical, a bit into my own world, and that I overthink things. I've come to consider those things as my way of engaging with the world.
