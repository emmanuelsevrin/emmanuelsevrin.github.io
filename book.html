	<h2><a>How to write well - by William Zinsser</a></h2>
	<p>An extensive essay on sharing our thoughts more effectively. Since itâ€™s a meta book (writings about writing), you can easily compare how effective the writer is in applying his own piece of  advice. And he definitely is ðŸ˜ƒ.  One of the most inspiring books Iâ€™ve read recently. </p>

	<h2><a>Models - by Mark Manson</a></h2>
	<p>Yes, itâ€™s a book about seduction, attracting women, and finding romance or love. Itâ€™s the best book on the topic, but more importantly it goes way beyond this and addresses questions about personality, attractiveness, and social relationships. Much deeper than all the pick-up books of the world - and way more effective. Useful for both genders as well. </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="The Life you can save - by Peter Singer" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/LifeSave.gif" alt="The Life you can save - by Peter Singer"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>The Life you can save - by Peter Singer</a></h2>
	<p>Best book on morality Iâ€™ve ever read. Forget Kant and the New Testament. This book challenged my personal moral system like no other and gave me a new way to consider my professional life and personal goals. At a minimum, the author points to the contradictions within us and forces us to reevaluate our personal moral system. At best, it can lead to the end of poverty and a new moral order.  </p>
