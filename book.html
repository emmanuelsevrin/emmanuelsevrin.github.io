	<h1>Books I admire</h1>
	This is a list of the most inspiring books Iâ€™ve read over the last 3 years, explaining how theyâ€™ve helped me grow and pursue inspiration.

<p> Sorted with my top recommendation on top. You can get what I learned from it when clicking.

	<h2><a>How to write well - by William Zinsser</a></h2>
	<p>An extensive essay on sharing our thoughts more effectively. Since itâ€™s a meta book (writings about writing), you can easily compare how effective the writer is in applying his own piece of  advice. And he definitely is ðŸ˜ƒ.  One of the most inspiring books Iâ€™ve read recently. </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="The Life you can save - by Peter Singer" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/LifeSave.gif" alt="The Life you can save - by Peter Singer"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>The Life you can save - by Peter Singer</a></h2>
	<p>Best book on morality Iâ€™ve ever read. Forget Kant and the New Testament. This book challenged my personal moral system like no other and gave me a new way to consider my professional life and personal goals. At a minimum, the author points to the contradictions within us and forces us to reevaluate our personal moral system. At best, it can lead to the end of poverty and a new moral order.  </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="Models - by Mark Manson" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/Models.gif" alt="Models - by Mark Manson"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>Models - by Mark Manson</a></h2>
	<p>Yes, itâ€™s a book about seduction, attracting women, and finding romance or love. Itâ€™s the best book on the topic, but more importantly it goes way beyond this and addresses questions about personality, attractiveness, and social relationships. Much deeper than all the pick-up books of the world - and way more effective. Useful for both genders as well. </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck - by Mark Manson" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/NotFuck.gif" alt="The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck - by Mark Manson"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck - by Mark Manson</a></h2>
	<p>Another Mark Manson book on how to live. This one somehow made it to best-seller status, although I have found the other one more thought-provoking and inspiring. Nevertheless, itâ€™s a deep piece of writing on our values and how to act according to them. Some brilliant passages.  </p>

	<div class="abook" data-title="Happy - by Derren Brown" >
	<figure><a><img src="./images/Happy.gif" alt="Happy - by Derren Brown"></a></figure>
	<h2><a>Happy - by Derren Brown</a></h2>
	<p>Powerful reminders of how the day-to-day experience of our lives is driven by our judgement more than the actual reality. Practical thoughts on how to apply those principles in many challenges of modern life, such as distraction, anger, anxiety and by rewriting our own personal stories. I was reminded of how much personal work I still need to do to engage creatively and generously with the people around me.  </p>
